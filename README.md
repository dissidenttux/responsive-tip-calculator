# Responsive Tip Calculator

A tip calculator:

- for the user on mobile,
- for register on desktop.

This webapp is used to calculate what a customer is supposed to pay for the tip at any commercial establishment
in which tips are given. Using this application on a mobile device will pull up a UI friendly for a customer who
doesn't want to whip out the pen and paper to donate to their server. On desktop, this application will serve a
UI more catered to an employee who is acting as a proxy for the customer, calculating the tip amount at checkout.
